# cra-template-altesack
This is just my react boilerplate to play with.

### Usage
This template is not published, so first you need to download it somewhere:

`git clone https://github.com/altesack/cra-template-altesack.git`

Then create your app from the template by command:

`yarn create react-app my-app --template file:./cra-template-altesack`
